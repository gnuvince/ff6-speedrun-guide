Final Fantasy 6 - Speed running guide
=====================================

A complete guide on how to speed run Final Fantasy 6 (SNES, any%, US version)

Thank you

- EssentiaFour: I watched her videos to know what to do and sharing her notes.
- MisterMV: I watched his videos to know what to do and sharing his notes. Also
  love the french interpretation of the Opera scene ;-)

TODO
----

- Finish the guide
- Reorganize sections (perhaps according to splits?)
- Play with different ways of presenting the information (it should be
  easy to glance at the document and know what to do), especially for
  the walkthroughs.
- Add more images for some walkthroughs?
- Information on the different game choices (Relics, Espers, etc.)
- Annotate items that we get for money
- Possibly switch from org-mode to straight-up LaTeX (advanced macros and commands)

- *Celes*: Vanish on Setzer
- *Sabin*: Muddle on Setzer
- *Gogo*: Remedy
- *Setzer*: /Slot/ 7-7-Bar

  - First Mimic tries to Reverse Joker Doom the previous enemy
  - Second one will hit this enemy

** Kefka
- *Gogo*: Mimic x2

* Techniques
** Joker Doom
Joker Doom is one of the possible outcome (7-7-7) of Setzer's Slot
ability.  It casts an instant death spell on all enemies.  The problem
is that very often, the game will not let you perform it; if you try
(using the pause button) to get all 7's, you'll find that you can get
the first two, but never the third one.

Fortunately, some very crafty folks have found a way around that. By
using an Echo Screen, you cause the RNG to allow you to get the 7-7-7.
And so, you can use Joker Doom pretty much any time you like.

- *Anyone*: /Item/ Echo Screen
- Wait for the first smoke cloud
- *Setzer*: /Slot/ 7-7-7

Note that if you miss the Joker Doom, you're done, you cannot put the
RNG back into the correct state.  Be careful!

** Reverse Joker Doom
In some battles, even though you can get Joker Doom working, the
enemies are immune to it.  However, a way around this has been
discovered and is called the Reverse Joker Doom.  It's more
complicated than the Joker Doom, and the execution is harder, but
it's guaranteed to work, even in the final battle!

- *Anyone*: /Magic/ Muddle on Setzer
- *Setzer*: /Slot/ 7-7-Bar (during Muddle birds animation)
- *Anyone*: /Attack/ Setzer OR /Item/ Remedy on Setzer

You need to start performing the Slot command _after_ the Muddle spell
has started and you need to finish your input _before_ the Muddle
animation is done, otherwise you lose control of Setzer.  This is hard
to do, and you should practice.

Note that contrary to the regular Joker Doom, you can re-do the
Reverse Joker Doom as many times as you like.

Now, how does this work?  It's a bit convoluted, but here's the
explanation.  Reverse Joker Doom (7-7-Bar) casts an instant death
spell on your own party!  Now, you'd think that by Muddling Setzer,
the Reverse Joker Doom would be cast against enemies, but the
developers thought of that.  However, they forgot to account for when
you use a remedy, and that flips the target of the Reverse Joker
Doom, and now it's the enemies that are targeted.
